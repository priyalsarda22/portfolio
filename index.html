                    Hello, welcome to my page! My name is Priyal Sarda. I am a biomedical engineering student at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the College of Engineering. I am currently exploring my interests in product development and medical device design for clinical applications, however, I am open to all related applications of engineering problem-solving towards improving patient outcomes. At Georgia Tech, I aspire to expand my experiences across the biomedical engineering community to be aware and adaptable in targeting new healthcare challenges and effectively developing innovative solutions. Please feel free to reach out to me through my email at priyal.sarda2002@gmail.com for any questions!

            <h2>About</h2>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                I am a Biomedical Engineering student at Georgia Institute of Technology graduating in December 2025!! Growing up, I watched family members navigate complex healthcare systems and saw firsthand how well-designed medical devices could transform patient outcomes. This sparked my passion for developing innovative medical technologies that genuinely improve the patient experience through rigorous engineering and thoughtful design.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have gained approximately 2 years of hands-on medical technology experience through co-ops spanning early-stage startups to global industry leaders like Johnson & Johnson. I am particularly drawn to the intersection of mechanical design, regulatory compliance, and hands-on prototyping—where creative engineering solutions must meet rigorous FDA standards. I thrive in collaborative environments and believe that diverse perspectives from surgeons, quality engineers, and manufacturing teams drive the best innovations.
            </p>

            <h3>Relevant Experiences and Interests</h3>
            <p>
                My academic focus centers on the complete medical device development lifecycle—from Voice of Customer research and concept generation through prototyping, Design Verification testing, regulatory documentation, and manufacturing implementation. Currently, I serve as Team Coordinator and Technical Lead for my Senior Capstone project developing an autonomous blood draw device for Emory University, where I manage cross-functional coordination, lead electromechanical integration, and establish Design Control frameworks per FDA 21 CFR Part 820.
            </p>
            <p>
                Professionally, I have gained exposure across multiple stages of the product development lifecycle through roles at Johnson & Johnson Medtech, early-stage medical device startups, and surgical manufacturing companies. My broader experience spans cardiovascular devices, ultrasound systems, pharmaceutical analytics, and surgical manufacturing—giving me perspective on different regulatory pathways (510(k), PMA), testing methodologies, and design-for-manufacturability considerations. I've worked extensively with SolidWorks for fixture and prototype design, conducted mechanical testing using Instron equipment in compliance with ISO/ASTM standards, and have hands-on experience with Arduino-based system integration, 3D printing, and iterative prototype development.
            </p>

            <h3>Professional Goals</h3>
            <p>
                I am seeking product development or R&D engineering roles that involve early-stage design, prototyping, and Design Verification testing within the medical device industry. I am particularly interested in rotational programs that provide exposure to different aspects of product development—from concept through commercialization. More specifically, I am drawn to cardiovascular devices, wearable medical technologies, and surgical instrumentation where mechanical innovation directly impacts patient care.
            </p>
            <p>
                On a broader level, I am energized by collaborative environments that balance rigorous regulatory requirements with creative problem-solving. I am excited by opportunities to work across the full development process—translating clinical needs into design requirements, building and testing prototypes, and ensuring designs meet both performance specifications and manufacturing feasibility.
